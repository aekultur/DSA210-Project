# DSA210-Term Project: The Impact of Inflation and Exchange Rates on Grocery Prices in Turkey
Especially in the last 5 years, Turkey has experienced many difficulties in shaping the cost of living due to high inflation and variable exchange rates. Grocery prices, which are a basic aspect of daily expenses, are one of the issues that reflect this difficulty. Therefore, the aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between inflation, exchange rates and grocery prices in Turkey and to observe the impact of these changes on consumers.

## Motivation
Purchasing power in Türkiye has fallen significantly in the last five years.

## Goal



## Hypothesis 
**H₀(Null Hypothesis):** Grocery prices in Turkey are not statistically significantly influenced by inflation or trade policies.

**Hₐ(Alternative Hypothesis):** Grocery prices are significantly influenced by inflation and changes in exchange rates; higher inflation and devaluation of currencies drive higher food prices.

## Data Collection and Sources
**Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT):** Historical exchange rate data (USD/TRY, EUR/TRY).

**Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and International Monetary Fund:** Monthly inflation rates, consumer price index (CPI), and grocery price index.

**International Organizations (IMF, World Bank):** Global food price indices for comparison.
