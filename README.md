# DSA210-Term Project: The Impact of Inflation and Exchange Rates on Grocery Prices in Turkey

## Motivation
Purchasing power in Türkiye has fallen significantly in the last five years.
Especially in the last 5 years, Turkey has experienced many difficulties in shaping the cost of living due to high inflation and variable exchange rates. Grocery prices, a basic aspect of daily expenses, are one of the issues that reflect this difficulty. Therefore, this project aims to analyze the relationship between inflation, exchange rates, and grocery prices in Turkey and to observe the impact of these changes on consumers.

## Goal

The goals I want to achieve at the end of this project are to understand how inflation and currency depreciation affect market prices, by examining historical data and applying data science techniques, this study will understand to what extent macroeconomic variables affect food prices and observe situations that will benefit the consumer.

## Objectives
1. Analyze historical trends
   
3. Analyze the impact of changing exchange rates:
   
4. Determine how inflation affects grocery prices.



## Hypothesis 
**H₀(Null Hypothesis):** Grocery prices in Turkey are not statistically significantly influenced by inflation or trade policies.

**Hₐ(Alternative Hypothesis):** Grocery prices are significantly influenced by inflation and changes in exchange rates; higher inflation and devaluation of currencies drive higher food prices.
