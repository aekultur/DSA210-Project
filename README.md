# DSA210-Term Project: The Impact of Inflation and Exchange Rates on Grocery Prices in Turkey

## Motivation
Purchasing power in Türkiye has fallen significantly in the last five years.
Especially in the last 5 years, Turkey has experienced many difficulties in shaping the cost of living due to high inflation and variable exchange rates. Grocery prices, a basic aspect of daily expenses, are one of the issues that reflect this difficulty. Therefore, this project aims to analyze the relationship between inflation, exchange rates, and grocery prices in Turkey and to observe the impact of these changes on consumers.

## Goal

The goals I want to achieve at the end of this project are to understand how inflation and currency depreciation affect market prices, by examining historical data and applying data science techniques, this study will understand to what extent macroeconomic variables affect food prices and observe situations that will benefit the consumer.

## Objectives
Analyze historical trends
- Analyze throughout the last years the trends in inflation, variations in exchange rates, and food pricing adjustments.
- List major times of significant inflation and devaluation of currencies and how these affected food costs.

Analyze the impact of changing exchange rates:
- Find out how imported food product pricing change with declining Turkish Lira value.
- Consider the price sensitivity of supermarket products imported from abroad against those made locally.
   
Determine how inflation affects grocery prices.
- Calculate the relationship between supermarket pricing hikes and overall inflation rates.
- Find whether food prices rise faster than general inflation.

## Hypothesis 
**H₀(Null Hypothesis):** Grocery prices in Turkey are not statistically significantly influenced by inflation or trade policies.

**Hₐ(Alternative Hypothesis):** Grocery prices are significantly influenced by inflation and changes in exchange rates; higher inflation and devaluation of currencies drive higher food prices.


## Data Analysis Approach
**Data Collection & Cleaning** 

Gather historical data from;
- **Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT):** Historical exchange rate data (USD/TRY, EUR/TRY).

- **Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and International Monetary Fund:** Monthly inflation rates, consumer price index (CPI), and grocery price index.

- **International Organizations (IMF, World Bank):** Global food price indices for comparison.

Handle missing values, eliminate contradictions, and standardize data to ensure validity.

Organize time-series data such that it is ready for study.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summarize important trends by means of descriptive statistical analysis.

- Find links among grocery prices, inflation, and exchange rates.

- Analyze past trends in price swings following changes in exchange rates or a recession.

- See long-term trends using moving averages and trend analysis.
