## Project Overview

## Objectives

## Motivation 
In today's world, social media has become an important part of daily life, but its effects on mental health are still causing more and more concern. An awful lot of people read social media for hours on end without thinking about how it might affect their mental health. The point of this project is to find out if making more use of social media leads to more stress and worse mood. By looking at personal data, the project aims to provide a data-driven view on how social media use affects mental health and encourages wise digital use for the greater good.
