# DSA210-Project
## Project Overview
I am Ayşe Ece Kültür, and this is my DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science) term project. This project aims to find the relationship between daily social media use and level of stress over the next three months. I will be investigating how the amount of time I spend on social media daily affects both my mood and my level of stress over the next three months. I intend to discover patterns and determine which behaviors contribute to emotional well-being or increased stress by monitoring characteristics such as total screen time, morning social media use, sleep duration, and self-reported mood and stress levels. 


**Hypothesis:** As daily social media usage time increases, mood score decreases, and it leads to an increase in stress levels throughout the day.

## Objectives

## Motivation 
In today's world, social media has become an important part of daily life, but its effects on mental health are still causing more and more concern. An awful lot of people read social media for hours on end without thinking about how it might affect their mental health. The point of this project is to find out if making more use of social media leads to more stress and a worse mood. By looking at personal data, the project aims to provide a data-driven view of how social media use affects mental health and encourages wise digital use for the greater good.
## Data 
For this study, the dataset is comprised of daily records spanning three months. Here is a list of the items that I will be monitoring:
- **Date:** The specific day the data is recorded.
- **Total Social Media Usage (min):** The total time spent on social media apps per day.
- **Morning Social Media Usage (min):** The amount of time spent on social media in the first hours following waking up.
- **Sleep Duration (hours):** The total amount of time spent sleeping the night before.
- **Mood Score:** Self-reported mood score (1 = very bad, 10 = very good).
- **Stress Level:** Self-reported stress level (1 = very low, 10 = very high).
- **Screen Time Before Sleep (min):** The amount of time spent using a phone within an hour of going to bed.
